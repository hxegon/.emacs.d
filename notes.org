_TODOS_
* Priorites
** TODO High (TODAY, RIGHT NOW)
- [ ] Hot path ergonomics
- [ ] File backup and restore
- [ ] clojure hydra, even if not context aware
- [ ] unfuck indentation and autocomplete
- [ ] COMMIT AND SAVE
** Medium
- [ ] normal text autocomplete that isn't spelling corrections
- [ ] better repeat command
- [ ] Dash usability
- [ ] Recent jumps?
- [ ] Auto save .emacs.d and work notes to dropbox or something
- [ ] Decent org bindings
- [ ] automatic hotpath identification
- [ ] Custom bindings auto cheatsheet
- [ ] All active bindings navigator. Fn name, binding, and docstring. Organized by global -> major modes -> minor modes with custom ones being hilighted. searchable
** Low
- [ ] per project layout manager
- [ ] emacs-client + repl in separate window on laptop?
- [ ] EVIL wrist slapper for repeated jjj/kkk/www etc

* Emacs
* Bindings
** Ideas
- [ ] designate a persistent set of buffers that all eval when you eval any one of them
** Global
- [ ] Save
- [ ] files
  - [ ] find by path
  - [ ] find recent/buffer
  - [ ] find in project
- [ ] buffers
  - [ ] delete buffer
- [ ] bookmarks
  - [ ] work notes
  - [ ] emacs notes
  - [ ] emacs config
- [ ] dirvish
- [ ] windows/splits
  - [ ] jump window
  - [ ] split vertically
  - [ ] other split
  - [ ] jump split
- [ ] avy word
** Context aware
*** Clojure mode
- [ ] Eval
    - [ ] eval buffer
    - [ ] eval top level sexp at point
    - [ ] eval last sexp
- [ ] repl
    - [ ] jack in
    - [ ] connect
    - [ ] open repl buffer
        - Smart?
            - clj gossamer -> clj gossamer repl
            - prompt for jack in/connect if no repl found

* EVIL
Define keys in package config
- [ ] wrist slapper for repeated jjj/kkk etc
* avy/swiper/counsel
Integrate better with evil.
- [ ] j/k/h/l (default normal mode), so easier nav with well sorted list and i for adding text.
- [ ]  m for mark, x to execute default, X to choose action and execute
* TODO Clojure
** LSP/cider integration
*** TODO Basic setup
*** TODO Balance cider/lsp
** Clojuremode hydra
** Lispville?
* TODO ORG
See org hydra binding
** Fix unergonomic evil behavior
** Link / reference to other subheading?
** Context aware bindings
- [ ] C-n/C-p for next/previous heading?
- [ ] Enter behavior
- [ ] subsection display
** Live notes markdown display?
Would be really cool to have a window open on my laptop screen with subsections for work notes displayed in formatted markdown
* TODO magit
Some kind of reminder, lets you know when you haven't commited changes more then a week old or something
** Context aware bindings
* TODO Terminal
- [ ] Change CMD-` to open hotwindow *in* emacs instead of from iterm.
  - [ ] if both hotkeys are enabled, could use iterm outside emacs and vterm inside. Shared tmux session?
  - [ ] Switch back and forth from/to most recent buffer, or open/switch to a split?
